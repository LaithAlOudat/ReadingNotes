#### <h6></h6> Heading: this is a level 6 heading in html
#### paragraph element: <p></p>. for paragraphs
#### bold font element: <b></b> to make your article in bold font
#### italic font element: <i></i> to make your article in italic font
#### superscript element: <sup></sup> to align your word to the top of other word
#### subscript element: <sub></sub> to align your word to the bottom of other word
#### white spaces :when the browsers render html all white spaces gets collapsed into a single space. So you have to use <b> element to breake the line.
#### semantic markup: are elements that are not affect the web page’s structure but they provide developers with extra information.
#### <strong> and <em> element: it’s use to indicate that this content has strong importance.

#### CSS used in html page structure by multiple ways. The first one is to use it in line with html code lines. Secondly to use it as an internal file in the head section. Last way is to use it with an external file and you have to link it with your html file. CSS use a specific form (selector {declaration}) and its properties have a certain form too (property: value)


## Chapter 2 (Basic Java Script instructions):
#### Statements: Green lines in code is a statements and in the pink color is a start and end of a code block. The purple lines determines which code should run.
#### Comments: you can write a comment for every developers will see your codes after you by using this (/*)
#### Variables: are a container that you can contain your data that you will repeat many times to faster your coding process. And you can declare a variable (var variable name = variable value). There are rules for variable names: 1) the name must begin with a letter, dollar sign or underscore.  2) The name can contain letters, numbers, dollar sign or an underscore.   3) You cannot use keywords or reserved words.  4) All variables are case sensitive   5) use a name that describes the kind of information that the variable stores.  6) Use a capital letters if your variables made of more than one word.
#### Data types in JS:

##### 2) String data type: and thing between “ “ and ‘ ‘ like ‘ hi My name is laith ‘ 
##### 3) Boolean data type: it’s return just true or false 
#### Expressions: evaluates into results in a single value
#### Operators: expressions rely on things called operators to short its multiple values to a single one.
## Chapter 4 (loops and decision making):
#### there is some situations you have to code that demand you to lean toward one of both chooses so you be able to continue with your code’s process you have to evaluate that condition and use conditional statements such as if condition and loops. Also the comparison operators can help you a lot in these complex situations and its form will be like (score <= pass/fail)
#### if statement is one of the most important code’s statements that you will use a lot
##### if statement form:
##### if (condition) { if condition true apply these statements } else { if condition false apply these statements }
#### loops: 
#### for loop form: for(counter sit up; condition; counter update){ apply these statements if the condition is true}
#### while loop form: while (condition) { if the condition true apply these statements}
