### canvas element:

##### <canvas> is an HTML element that can be used to draw graphics via scripting (usually JavaScript). This can, for instance, be used to draw graphs, combine photos, or create simple (and not so simple) animations. 

##### Using the canvas element is not very difficult, but you do need a basic understanding of html and javascript ##### The canvas element is not supported in some older browsers, but is supported in recent versions of all major browsers. The default size of the canvas is 300 pixels × 150 pixels (width × height). But custom sizes can be defined using the HTML height and width property. In order to draw graphics on the canvas we use a JavaScript context object, which creates graphics on the fly.

##### canvas actually has two sizes: the size of the element itself and the size of the element's drawing surface. Setting the element's width and height attributes sets both of these sizes; CSS attributes affect only the element's size and not the drawing surface. By default, both the canvas element's size and the size of its drawing surface are 300 screen pixels wide and 150 screen pixels high. In the listing shown in the example, which uses CSS to set the canvas element's size, the size of the element is 600 pixels wide and 300 pixels high, but the size of the drawing surface remains unchanged at the default value of 300 pixels × 150 pixels. When a canvas element's size does not match the size of its drawing surface, the browser scales the drawing surface to fit the element (which may result in surprising and unwanted effects).
