### CSS Transforms, Transitions, and Animations:

##### Transforms are a new way to change the position and alter images. It can be two dimensional and three dimensional. The two dimensional transforms work on the x and y axis. The three dimensional transforms work on the x, y and z axis which will play with the width, height, and depth of the element.
###### 2D Rotate: the ability to rotate an element from 0 to 360 degrees.
###### 2D Scale: using the scale value within the transform property allows you to change the appeared size of an element.
###### 2D Translate: using the translateX value will change the position of an element on the horizontal axis while using the translateY value will change the position of an element on the vertical axis.
###### 2D Skew: is used to distort elements on the horizontal axis, vertical axis, or both.
###### 3D Rotate: rotateX, rotateY, and rotateZ.
###### 3D Scale: the scaleZ three-dimensional using to transform elements may be scaled on the z axis
