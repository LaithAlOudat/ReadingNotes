##### one of the most public proselytizers of how studying workers can transform productivity — became focused on building the perfect team. In the last decade, the tech giant has spent untold millions of dollars measuring nearly every aspect of its employees’ lives. Google’s People Operations department has scrutinized everything from how frequently particular people eat together (the most productive employees tend to build larger networks by rotating dining companions) to which traits the best managers share (unsurprisingly, good communication and avoiding micromanaging is critical; more shocking, this was news to many Google managers).
##### the psychological environment takes a huge part of the team’s productivity, the respect that each member gets and the equal chances have huge effect on how they will work.
##### Instead, the researchers found that there were five key characteristics of enhanced teams:

###### 1) Psychological safety: Everyone feels safe in taking risks around their team members, and that they won’t be embarrassed or punished for doing so.
###### 2) Dependability: Everyone completes quality work on time.
###### 3) Structure and clarity: Everyone knows what their specific expectations are. These expectations must be challenging yet attainable.
###### 4) Meaning: Everyone has a sense of purpose in their work (i.e., financial security, supporting family, helping the team succeed, etc.).
###### 5) Impact: Everyone sees that the result of their work actually contributes to the organization’s overall goals.
