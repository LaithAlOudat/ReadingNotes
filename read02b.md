#### *first of all, you have to know what version control is. Version Control: is a system that allow you to see all your various versions of a file or set of files by recording changes. There are two type of version control: Local Version Control and Cloud Version Control. The difference between the two type is Local Version Control is one database on your device that stores changes to files but Cloud version control is multiple database on the specific platform to share, collaborate to develop, and distribute software's versions like GitHub.com.* 

#### *Now, What is Git exactly? Git is a Cloud Version Control platform that store data in a file system made up of snapshots every time you change something on your project called commit to store a reference to who did it. it's relies on local operations due to most necessary information can be found in local resources and this allows for process expediency because a project's history resides on the local disk. Git can track every single change applied on any file and detect any file corruption or loss of information.*

#### *ACP: add, commit, and push. Add, to add something on your project. Commit, to refer who did the changes and what was changed. Push, to push everything changed on your project to github platform.*
#### *(git add) command to tell git that i make changes and put these changes to your tracking system*
#### *(git commit) command to mention who did the changes and what is changed*
#### *(git push origin) command to push your changes to GitHub cloud*
#### * Examples for some command:
#### * Default Text Editor: git config --global core.editor emacs
#### * Check Settings: git config --list
#### * Importing: cd test (to change directory)
