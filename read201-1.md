## Html: is a computer language that we use to structure and write web pages. Documents are the building blocks of the web.

### The web: is collection of documents written in html along with other resources such as images and videos. As well as programs and services that interact with these documents and resources.
### The web is a hypertext system that documents, webpages, websites, and web applications can contain references to other documents and users can follow those references to find related information.
### all of the web technology is built around this idea of documents and other data objects that can link to each other in a standard way.
 ### Web browser: is an application like chrome, fire fox, and edge that designed for displaying webpages.
### web pages are usually stored on servers.
### a server might be like your personal computer but it has programs running on it that answer browser’s requests.
### to load a web page your browser sends a request for that page to a server.
### URLs: are the addresses that we use to refer to documents and sites on the web.
### a web page can include resources such as videos, images, fonts and program code from the same web server or from other web servers.
### web browsers and servers interact in a pretty specific way. When you go to a web page or follow a link your browser makes a request to the server asking for a particular documents by name and the server sends a response back to the browser containing that document or if it can’t find that document it sends an error message instead ( this process called HTTP or hypertext transfer protocol ).

## Some important concepts for html and programmers:-
### Syntax: Grammar rules of a language and syntax error is an ungrammatical code that wouldn’t make sense for computers.
### Formalism: computers take code totally literally word for word, letter for letter. Computers cannot guess what you really mean. It can only do what you tell it to so you always have to be careful with spelling and punctuction in programming.
### Nesting: it has to do with how some bit of code can go inside other bits of code in an orderly way.
### documentation: There are so many helps out there like tutorials.

## Text Editor:
### almost every programming languages are written in text files.
### Text files:-
#### 1- contain nothing but characters: letters, numbers, spaces, punctuation and so on.
#### 2- They don’t contain any special topography such as bold, italics, colors, images or videos.
#### 3- anything you can write on an old fashioned typewriter.
